# WSL2 Latest kernel releases

In this repository you will find already compiled images of the kernel as well as its tagged source code.

The original repository is a constant testing and mixing between the official repositories of:

- https://www.kernel.org/
- https://github.com/microsoft/WSL2-Linux-Kernel

Since Microsoft does not update kernels "to the latest version" for obvious testing and optimization reasons, even images from kernel.org will not work directly on WSL2 without adaptation.

> **PRECOMPILED KERNELS READY FOR WSL2**: https://github.com/peseoane/linux-wsl2/releases

In principle, only the most relevant images from the channels are kept up to date (as far as I can):

- mainline
- stable
- longterm

**EOL images are not supported and should not be used in a production environment.**

## Instalation (NEW WAY)
Create in your `C:\Users\YOURUSER\.wsl` a `dotfile` with the name `.wslconfig` and the following text:

```powershell
[wsl2]
kernel=C:\\WSL\\Kernel\\stable-5.12.10
```

Just put the full path to your compiled image or download.

The name is totally indiferent, if you download one of my releases `bzImage` will work with that name.

Now restart your `wsl` in `Powershell` or `cmd` with:

```powerhsell
wsl --shutdown
```

## Instalation (OLD WAY)

To update the kernel, from PowerShell you must invoke the following command:

```powershell
wsl --shutdown
```
Once you have done this, open the folder: `C:\Windows\System32\Tools`

Where you **must rename the kernel file to kernel.old or whatever you want**, and the **bzimage file to kernel**.

## Custom compilation

As always, you need the dev-kit, in Ubuntu or Debian just do:

```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libncurses-dev bison flex libssl-dev libelf-dev
```

And just clone, choose one branch and you're ready to go with your changes.

## ¿Will work on my system?

The distributed versions are optimised for modern processors, with the following parameters and specially tuned for Intel, but works also in AMD, **i suggest you to recompile with your native system:**

```bash
export KCFLAGS="-O2 -mtune=native -pipe" KCPPFLAGS="-O2 -mtune=native -pipe"
make all
```

> NOTE: this dosen't work anymore on Intel 11th gen, JUST DON'T DO THAT beacuase needs `gcc-10` and `g++-10` and the linker isn't supporter yet, default optimization is for Intel Core Duo / Xeon an 02 flag.

### ¿Where can i copy my bzimage?

Just open `\\wsl$` in file explorer, go to `linux/arch/x86/boot` and copy the `bzimage`, later copy on `C:\Windows\System32\Tools` and repeat the steps described at the start of the readme.
